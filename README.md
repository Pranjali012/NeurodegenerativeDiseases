# Neurodegenerative Diseases Prediction using Deep Learning

This project uses a deep learning model combining VGG16 and LSTM attention mechanisms to predict the stage of neurodegenerative diseases. The model achieves an impressive test accuracy of 98.64%.

## Project Overview

- **Model Used**: VGG16 combined with LSTM and Attention
- **Test Accuracy**: 98.64%
- **Task**: Prediction of neurodegenerative diseases and their stage

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Flask (for the web interface)
- Other dependencies (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <filename>
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python app.py
2. **Open URL**
   After running the command, you will see a local server URL (usually http://127.0.0.1:5000/). Open this URL in your browser.
3. **Signup and Login**
    Once the application is running, you can sign up for an account and log in to access the application interface.
